.. Fedora 21 now available on Digital Ocean
.. ========================================

*cross posted from this_ fedora magazine post*

It's raining Droplets! Fedora 21 has landed in Digital Ocean's cloud
hosting. Fedora 21 offers a fantastic cloud image for developers, and
it's now easy for Digital Ocean users to spin it up and get started!
Here are a couple of tips:

- Like with other Digital Ocean images, you will log in with your ssh
  key as **root** rather than the typical **fedora** user that you may
  be familiar with when logging in to a Fedora cloud image. 

- This is the first time Digital Ocean has SELinux enabled by default
  (yay for security). If you want or need to you can still easily
  switch back to permissive mode; Red Hat's Dan Walsh may have a
  *"shame on you"* or two for you though.

- Fedora 21 should be available in all the newest datacenters in each
  region, but some legacy datacenters aren't supported. If you have a
  problem you think is Fedora specific then drop us an email at
  cloud@lists.fedoraproject.org, ping us in #fedora-cloud on
  freenode, or visit the Fedora cloud trac_ to see if it is already 
  being worked on.
