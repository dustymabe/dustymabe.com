**NOTE**: The fourth post of this series is available [here](/2020/09/27/openshift-okd-on-fedora-coreos-on-digitalocean-part-3-upgrading/).

This blog post is the fifth in a series that illustrates how to 
set up an [OpenShift OKD](https://www.okd.io/) cluster on 
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

Back on August 17th I highlighted this blog post series with a
presentation and demo for the OKD working group's Demo Marathon.

The video is [posted on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow-AFgUQOqk)
and also available below. If you're interested take some time and
watch the whole process work and see a cluster up and running at the end.
