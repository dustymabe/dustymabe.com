I ran across a great
[PDF](http://rhsummit.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/doerbeck_w_1320_lvm_fundamentals_lab.pdf)
from this year's Red Hat Summit in Boston. Hosted by Christoph Doerbech
and Jonathan Brassow the lab covers the following topics:\

-   What is LVM? What are filesystems? etc..
-   Creating PVs, VGs, LVs.
-   LVM Striping and Mirroring.
-   LVM Raid.
-   LVM Snapshots (and reverting).
-   LVM Sparse Volumes (a snapshot of /dev/zero).
-   LVM Thin LVs and new snapshots.

Check out the PDF
[here](http://rhsummit.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/doerbeck_w_1320_lvm_fundamentals_lab.pdf)
. If that link ceases to work at some point I have it hosted
[here](/2013-09-15/doerbeck_w_1320_lvm_fundamentals_lab.pdf) as well.\

Hope everyone can use this as a great learning tool!\
