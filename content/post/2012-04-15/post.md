Traditionally with `script` you have really only been able to log the
output of a simple "single session" terminal window. However, if you
capture the timing data from `script` you can actually log much more
than that.\
\
In a [previous post](/2012/01/11/create-a-screencast-of-a-terminal-session-using-scriptreplay./)
I talked about how to save the timing data using `script` and then play
it back using `scriptreplay`. If you use this technique and also use a a
terminal multiplexer such as `screen` or `tmux` you can capture much
more information in your screencast.\
\
To see an example of this you can watch the video below where I use
`scriptreplay` to play back an earlier recorded screencast.\

**NOTE:** You must have an HTML5 capable browser.

Additionally, you can download the
[**screencast.timing**](/2012-04-15/screencast.timing) and
[**screencast.log**](/2012-04-15/screencast.log) if you like.\
