<! Terminal Screencast Revisit: Log output from a multiplexed terminal >

<br>

Traditionally with <code>script</code> you have really only been able
to log the output of a simple "single session" terminal window. However, 
if you capture the timing data from <code>script</code> you can actually 
log much more than that. 

<br><br>

In a
<a href="/2012/01/11/create-a-screencast-of-a-terminal-session-using-scriptreplay/">
previous post
</a>
I talked about how to save the timing data using <code>script</code>
and then play it back using <code>scriptreplay</code>. If you use this
technique and also use a a terminal multiplexer such as
<code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> you can capture much more
information in your screencast. 

<br><br>

To see an example of this you can watch the video below where I use
<code>scriptreplay</code> to play back an earlier recorded screencast.

<br><br>

<video controls autobuffer width="480" height="270" src="/2012-04-15/screencast.mp4">
    <div class="fallback">
            <p>You must have an HTML5 capable browser.</p>
    </div>
</video>

<br><br>

Additionally, you can download the

<b>screencast.timing</b>
</a>
and 
<a href="/2012-04-15/screencast.log">
<b>screencast.log</b>
</a>
if you like.
