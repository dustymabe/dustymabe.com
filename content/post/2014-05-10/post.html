<! Zero to Wordpress on Docker in 5 Minutes >

<h4><i> Introduction </i></h4>

<br>

<a href="https://www.docker.io/">
Docker
</a>
is an emerging technology that has garnered a lot of
momentum in the past year. I have been busy with a move 
to NYC and a job change (now officially a Red Hatter), so I am just
now getting around to getting my feet wet with Docker. 

<br><br>

Last night I sat down and decided to bang out some steps for
installing wordpress in a docker container. Eventually I plan to move
this site into a container so I figured this would be a good first
step.

<h4><i> DockerPress </i></h4>

<br>

There a few bits and pieces that need to be done to configure
wordpress. For simplicity I decided to make this wordpress instance
use <code>sqlite</code> rather than <code>mysql</code>. Considering
all of this here is the basic recipe for wordpress:

<br>

<ul>
    <li> Install <code>apache</code> and <code>php.</code>
    <li> Download <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/download">wordpress</a> and extract to appropriate folder.
    <li> Download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/installation/"> sqlite-integration</a> plugin
         and extract.
    <li> Modify a few files...and DONE.
</ul>

This is easily automated by creating a Dockerfile and using docker. The 
minimal Dockerfile (with comments) is shown below:

<br>

<blockquote>
FROM       goldmann/f20
MAINTAINER Dusty Mabe <dustymabe@gmail.com>

# Install httpd and update openssl
RUN yum install -y httpd openssl unzip php php-pdo

# Download and extract wordpress
RUN curl -o wordpress.tar.gz http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
RUN tar -xzvf wordpress.tar.gz --strip-components=1 --directory /var/www/html/
RUN rm wordpress.tar.gz

# Download plugin to allow WP to use sqlite
# http://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/installation/
#     - Move sqlite-integration folder to wordpress/wp-content/plugins folder.
#     - Copy db.php file in sqlite-integratin folder to wordpress/wp-content folder.
#     - Rename wordpress/wp-config-sample.php to wordpress/wp-config.php.
#
RUN curl -o sqlite-plugin.zip http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/sqlite-integration.1.6.3.zip
RUN unzip sqlite-plugin.zip -d /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/
RUN rm sqlite-plugin.zip
RUN cp /var/www/html/wp-content/{plugins/sqlite-integration/db.php,}
RUN cp /var/www/html/{wp-config-sample.php,wp-config.php}

#
# Fix permissions on all of the files
RUN chown -R apache /var/www/html/
RUN chgrp -R apache /var/www/html/

#
# Update keys/salts in wp-config for security
RUN                                     \
    RE='put your unique phrase here';   \
    for i in {1..8}; do                 \
        KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 40); \
        sed -i "0,/$RE/s|$RE|$KEY|" /var/www/html/wp-config.php;  \
    done;                      

#
# Expose port 80 and set httpd as our entrypoint
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/httpd"]
CMD ["-D", "FOREGROUND"]
</blockquote>

<br>

With the power of the Dockerfile you can now build a new image using 
<code>docker build</code> and then run the new container with the 
<code>docker run</code> command. An example of these two commands is shown
below:

<br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# ls Dockerfile
Dockerfile
[root@localhost ~]# docker build -t "wordpress" .
...
Successfully built 0b388013905e
...
[root@localhost ~]#
[root@localhost ~]# docker run  -d -p 8080:80 -t wordpress
6da59c864d35bb0bb6043c09eb8b1128b2c1cb91f7fa456156df4a0a22f271b0
</blockquote>

<br>

The <code>docker build</code> command will build an image from the Dockerfile
and then tag the new image with the "wordpress" tag. The <code>docker run</code>
command will run a new container based on the "wordpress" image and bind 
port 8080 from the host machine to port 80 within the container.

<br><br>

Now you can happily point your browser to http://localhost:8080 and see the 
wordpress 5 minute installation screen:
