<! Recover Space By Finding Deleted Files That Are Still Held Open.  >
<br><br>

The other day I was trying to clean out some space on an almost full
filesystem that I use to hold some video files. The output from
<code> df</code> looked like:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
media:~ # df -kh /docs/videos/
Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vgvolume-videos 5.0G  4.2G  526M  90% /docs/videos
</blockquote>

<br>

I then found the largest file I wanted to delete (a 700M avi
video I had recently watched), and removed it. <code> df</code>
should now report that I freed up some space right? NOPE!

<br><br>

<blockquote>
media:~ # df -kh /docs/videos/
Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vgvolume-videos 5.0G  4.2G  526M  90% /docs/videos
</blockquote>

<br>

Why wasn't I able to recover the space on the filesystem? At first I
didn't know. I then decided to unmount and remount the filesystem to
see if the changes would take effect. During this process, I found out
that I couldn't unmont the fs because the device was busy:


<br><br>

<blockquote>
media:~ # umount /docs/videos/
umount: /docs/videos: device is busy.
    (In some cases useful info about processes that use
     the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))
</blockquote>


<br>

Ahh, so a program still has some files open on the fs. <code>
lsof</code> lets us find out what files. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
media:~ # lsof /docs/videos/
COMMAND     PID      USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE  SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
bash      10889 dustymabe  cwd    DIR  253,6      4096    2 /docs/videos
vlc       11244 dustymabe  cwd    DIR  253,6      4096    2 /docs/videos
vlc       11244 dustymabe   11r   REG  253,6 732297098   14 /docs/videos/video1.avi (deleted)
xdg-scree 11281 dustymabe  cwd    DIR  253,6      4096    2 /docs/videos
xprop     11285 dustymabe  cwd    DIR  253,6      4096    2 /docs/videos
</blockquote>


<br>

So <code> lsof</code> shows us what files are open but it also let me us know
something else key to my investigation. The file I had deleted was actually still 
being held open by VLC media player (I had recently been watching the video and 
vlc was still up and paused in the middle of playback). <code> lsof</code> let us know
that the file had been deleted as well. 

After closing vlc the space was then released back to the filesystem :)

<br>

<blockquote>
media:~ # df -kh /docs/videos/
Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vgvolume-videos 5.0G  3.5G  1.2G  75% /docs/videos
</blockquote>

<br><br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><br>

As a side note it is worth mentioning that all files that have been
deleted but are still be held open by running processes are listed as 
"(deleted)" when performing an <code> ls -l</code>  in the proc file system.

For example, to find the file that I deleted that was still being held open
by vlc then I would use <code> ls -lR /proc/11244/fd/ | grep deleted</code>.
An example of the output is shown below:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
media:~ # ls -l /proc/11244/fd/ | grep deleted
lr-x------ 1 dustymabe users 64 Jan 22 21:58 11 -> /docs/videos/video1.avi (deleted)
