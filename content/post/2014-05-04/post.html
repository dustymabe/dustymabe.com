<! Fedup 19 to 20 with a Thin LVM Configuration >

<h4><i> Introduction </i></h4>

<br>

I have been running my home desktop on thin logical volumes for a
<a href="/2013/09/07/convert-an-existing-system-to-use-thin-lvs/">
while now.
</a>
I have enjoyed the flexibility of this setup and I like taking a snapshot
before making any big changes to my setup. Recently I decided to
update to Fedora 20 from Fedora 19 and I hit some trouble along the
way because the Fedora 20 initramfs
(<code>images/pxeboot/upgrade.img</code>) that is used by <code>fedup</code>
for the upgrade does not have support for thin logical volumes. 
After running <code>fedup</code> and rebooting you end up with a 
message to the screen that looks something like this:

<br>

<blockquote>

[  OK  ] Reached target Paths.
[  OK  ] Reached target Basic System.

<h4><i> Working Around the Issue </i></h4>

<br>

First off run install and run <code>fedup</code> :

<br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# yum update -y fedup fedora-release &>/dev/null
[root@localhost ~]# fedup --network 20                 &>/dev/null 
</blockquote>

<br>

After running <code>fedup</code> usually you would be able to reboot
and go directly into the upgrade process. For us we need to add a few 
helper utilities (thin_dump, thin_check, thin_restore)  to the initramfs so 
that thin LVs will work. This can be
done by appending more files in a <code>cpio</code> archive to the end of
the initramfs that was downloaded by <code>fedup</code>. I learned about this
technique by peeking at the <code>initramfs_append_files()</code> function within fedup's 
<a href="https://github.com/wgwoods/fedup/blob/1e76a80b3149360ba14419cf2b215a679240a0ea/fedup/boot.py#L46">
boot.py.
</a>
Note also that I had to append a few libraries that are required by the utilities into
the initramfs as well. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# cpio -co >> /boot/initramfs-fedup.img << EOF
/lib64/libexpat.so.1
/lib64/libexpat.so.1.6.0
/lib64/libstdc++.so.6
/lib64/libstdc++.so.6.0.18
/usr/sbin/thin_dump
/usr/sbin/thin_check
/usr/sbin/thin_restore
EOF
4334 blocks
[root@localhost ~]#
</blockquote>

<br>

And thats it.. You are now able to reboot into the upgrade environment and 
watch the upgrade. If you'd like to watch a (rather lengthy) screencast of the
entire process then you can download the 
<a href="/2014-05-04/screencast.log">screencast.log</a>
and the 
<a href="/2014-05-04/screencast.timing">screencast.timing</a>
files and follow the instructions
<a href="/2012/01/11/create-a-screencast-of-a-terminal-session-using-scriptreplay/">
here.
