<! Mount Complex Disk Images Using libguestfs >

<br>

In my previous
<a
href="http://dustymabe.com/2012/12/15/mounting-a-partition-within-a-disk-image/">
post
</a>
I went over two ways to mount a partition within a disk image file.
There is actually another easy way to do this by utilizing some of the
tools that the <i>virt</i> community has provided us in recent years. 

<br><br>

<a href="http://libguestfs.org/">
libguestfs
</a>
is a fairly comprehensive library for manipulating guest disk images
and filesystems. It turns out that the tools work pretty well even for
disk images that aren't specific to any virtualized guest; after all
a disk image is a disk image. 

<br><br>

The <code>guestmount</code> utility is
provided as part of the <i>libguestfs-tools-c</i> package in Fedora 17
and allows us the ability to (in)directly mount the second partition of
our disk image. This is shown below:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
dustymabe@media: > guestmount -a /mnt/lenovo.img -m /dev/sda2 --ro /tmp/mnt
dustymabe@media: > ls /tmp/mnt/Users/
All Users  Default  Default User  desktop.ini  dustymabe  Public
</blockquote>

<br>

The only drawback I can see at this point from using this tool is that
it is using 
<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">
fuse
</a>
under the covers to mount the filesystem. This has some advantages and
disadvantages but typically results in lower performance.
Nevertheless, <code>guestmount</code> and the other tools provided by
<i>libguestfs</i> are no doubt becoming very useful for manipulating
disk images. 

<br><br>

Cheers!
