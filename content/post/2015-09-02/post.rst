.. ======================================

Hey everyone! Fedora 23 has been baking in the oven. The Fedora Cloud
WG has elected to do a temperature check on September 8th. 

For this test day we are going to concentrate on the base image. We
will have vagrant boxes (see 
`this page <http://fedoramagazine.org/running-vagrant-fedora-22/>`_
for how to set up 
your machine), qcow images, raw images, and AWS EC2 images. 
In a later test day we will focus on the Atomic images and Docker images. 

The landing page for the Fedora Cloud Base test day is here_.
If you're available to test on the test day (or any other time) please go there
and fill out your name and test results. Also, don't forget that you
can use some of our new projects testcloud_ (copr link_) and/or Tunir_ to aid in
testing.
