<! Hard Drive Monitoring and E-mail Alerts Using smartd >

<br>

A while back I set up <code>mdadm</code> to monitor my RAID array and
send email alerts to notify me of failures. At the same time I also set
up <code>smartd</code> (see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.">S.M.A.R.T.</a> 
) to monitor the hard drives themselves and to send me email alerts. 

<br><br>

To do this you edit the <code>/etc/smartd.conf</code> file. After I
was done my <code>/etc/smartd.conf</code> file looked like the
following:

<blockquote>
#
# HERE IS A LIST OF DIRECTIVES FOR THIS CONFIGURATION FILE.
# PLEASE SEE THE smartd.conf MAN PAGE FOR DETAILS
#
#   -d TYPE Set the device type: ata, scsi, marvell, removable, 3ware,N, hpt,L/M/N
#   -T TYPE set the tolerance to one of: normal, permissive
#   -o VAL  Enable/disable automatic offline tests (on/off)
#   -S VAL  Enable/disable attribute autosave (on/off)
#   -n MODE No check. MODE is one of: never, sleep, standby, idle
#   -H      Monitor SMART Health Status, report if failed
#   -l TYPE Monitor SMART log.  Type is one of: error, selftest
#   -f      Monitor for failure of any 'Usage' Attributes
#   -m ADD  Send warning email to ADD for -H, -l error, -l selftest, and -f
#   -M TYPE Modify email warning behavior (see man page)
#   -s REGE Start self-test when type/date matches regular expression (see man page)
#   -p      Report changes in 'Prefailure' Normalized Attributes
#   -u      Report changes in 'Usage' Normalized Attributes
#   -t      Equivalent to -p and -u Directives
#   -r ID   Also report Raw values of Attribute ID with -p, -u or -t
#   -R ID   Track changes in Attribute ID Raw value with -p, -u or -t
#   -i ID   Ignore Attribute ID for -f Directive
#   -I ID   Ignore Attribute ID for -p, -u or -t Directive
#   -C ID   Report if Current Pending Sector count non-zero
#   -U ID   Report if Offline Uncorrectable count non-zero
#   -W D,I,C Monitor Temperature D)ifference, I)nformal limit, C)ritical limit
#   -v N,ST Modifies labeling of Attribute N (see man page)
#   -a      Default: equivalent to -H -f -t -l error -l selftest -C 197 -U 198
#   -F TYPE Use firmware bug workaround. Type is one of: none, samsung
#   -P TYPE Drive-specific presets: use, ignore, show, showall
#    #      Comment: text after a hash sign is ignored
#    \      Line continuation character
# Attribute ID is a decimal integer 1 <= ID <= 255
# except for -C and -U, where ID = 0 turns them off.
# All but -d, -m and -M Directives are only implemented for ATA devices
#
# If the test string DEVICESCAN is the first uncommented text
# then smartd will scan for devices /dev/hd[a-l] and /dev/sd[a-z]
DEVICESCAN -o on -H -l error -l selftest -t -m dustymabe@gmail.com -M test

</blockquote>

It is pretty much all comments except for the last line. You can see
from the comments what each option on the last line means. To
summarize I am telling <code>smartd</code> to:

<br><br>

<i>"Monitor the health status as well as the error and selftest logs
of all /dev/hd[a-l] and /dev/sd[a-z] devices that are discovered to have
SMART capabilities. Report any errors/failures as well as startup test
messages to dustymabe@gmail.com."
</i>

<br><br>

Now just make sure the <code>smartd</code> service is configured to run by
default and your disks should be monitored! You can check this by
looking to see if you get an email when <code>smartd</code> starts
(make sure to check your spam filter).
