<! Nested Virt and Fedora 20 Virt Test Day >

<h4><i> Introduction </i></h4>

<br>

I decided this year to take part in the 
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-08_Virtualization">Fedora Virtualization Test Day
</a>
on October 8th. In order to take part I needed a system with Fedora 20
installed so that I could then create VMs on top. Since I like my
current setup and I didn't have a hard drive laying around that I
wanted to wipe I decided to give nested virtualization a shot.  

<br><br>

Most of the documentation I have seen for nested virtualization has
come from 
<a href="http://kashyapc.wordpress.com/">Kashyap Chamarthy</a>.
Relevant posts are 
<a href="https://github.com/kashyapc/nvmx-haswell/blob/master/SETUP-nVMX.rst">here,</a>

and

He has done a great job with these tutorials and this post is
nothing more than my notes for what I found to work for me.

<h4><i> Steps </i></h4>

<br>

With nested virtualization the OS/Hypervisor that touches the physical
hardware is known as L0. The first level of virtualized guest is known
as L1. The second level of virtualized guest (the guest inside a
guest) is known as L2. In my setup I ultimately wanted F19(L0),
F20(L1), and F20(L2). 

<br><br>


First, in order to pass along intel vmx extensions to the guest I 
created a modprobe config file that instructs the kvm_intel kernel
module to allow nested virtualization support:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@L0 ~]# echo "options kvm-intel nested=y" > /etc/modprobe.d/nestvirt.conf
</blockquote>

<br>

After a reboot I can now confirm the kvm_intel moduel is configured
for nested virt:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@L0 ~]# cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
Y
</blockquote>

<br>

Next I converted an existing Fedora 20 installation to use
"host-passthrough" (see
<a href="http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU">here</a>)
so that the L1 guest would see the same processor (with vmx
extensions) as my L0 host. To do this i modified the cpu xml tags as
follows in the libvirt xml definition:


<br><br>

<blockquote>
  &ltcpu mode='host-passthrough'&gt
  &lt/cpu&gt
</blockquote>

<br>


After powering up the guest I now see that the processor that the
L1 guest sees is indeed the same as the host:


<blockquote>
[root@L1 ~]# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
</blockquote>

<br>

Next I decided to enable nested virt in the L1 guest by adding the same
modprobe.conf file as I did in L0. I did this based on a tip from
Kashyap in the #fedora-test-day chat that this tends to give about a
10X performance improvement in the L2 guests. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@L1 ~]# echo "options kvm-intel nested=y" > /etc/modprobe.d/nestvirt.conf
</blockquote>

<br>

After a reboot I could then create and install L2 guests using virt-install and
virt-manager. This seemed to work fine except for the fact that I
would often see an unknown NMI in the guest periodically. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[   14.324786] Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 30 on CPU 0.
[   14.325046] Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
[   14.325046] Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
</blockquote>

<br>


I believe the issue I was seeing may be documented in kernel 
<a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58941">
BZ#58941
</a>. After asking about it in the chat I was informed that for the best
experience with nested virt I should go to a 3.12 kernel. I decided to
leave that exercise for another day :).

<br><br>

Have a great day!
