<! Create A Disk Image Without Enough Free Space >

<br><br>

Recently I purchased a new laptop. Typically my first move is to ditch
Windows or Mac (yes I've done both) and install Linux. This time, just
in case I ever want to completely restore the system (recovery
partition and all), I decided to make a disk image of the entire hard
drive. 

<br><br>

Being that the capacity of the hard drive is close to 500 GB it
actually turned out that I didn't have enough free space to store the
entire image. However, since it was a brand new computer I knew there
was plenty of zeroes on the disk and thus plenty of opportunity to
reduce the actual size of the disk image by converting those zeroes
into holes in a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file">sparse file</a>
.

<br><br>

Now usually when creating a disk image I would just use
<code>dd</code>, but <code>dd</code> doesn't have any options that are
sparse file aware. Luckily I was able to find a 
<a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/93667/create-image-from-hard-disk-without-free-space-linux">page</a> 
that addressed my particular predicament.

<br><br>

The secret sauce here is the <code>--sparse=always</code> option of
<code>cp</code>. By piping the output of <code>dd</code> to
<code>cp</code>, I could then copy my disk image! The next step was to
fire up a live cd, connect an external hard drive and run the
following command to create the disk image:

<br>

<blockquote>
dd if=/dev/sda | cp --sparse=always /dev/stdin lenovo.img
</blockquote>

Just to be careful I decided to md5sum both the disk image and the
block device to make sure they had the same sums:

<br>

<blockquote>
dustymabe@media: >sudo md5sum lenovo.img
fbd07bc0fc46622e0bfc1ac2b44915e5  lenovo.img

ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo md5sum /dev/sda 
fbd07bc0fc46622e0bfc1ac2b44915e5  /dev/sda
</blockquote>

Success! So how much space did I actually save by make the image a
sparse image? We can see by using the <code>du</code> command:

<blockquote>
dustymabe@media: mnt>du -sh lenovo.img
38G     lenovo.img
dustymabe@media: mnt>du -sh --apparent-size lenovo.img
466G    lenovo.img
</blockquote>

This means that the disk image only actually took 38 GB of disk space 
but would have taken 466 GB if I had not
made it a sparse disk image... Mission accomplished!!

<br><br>

Until next time...
