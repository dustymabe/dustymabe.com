<! Trace Function Calls Using GDB >

<br>

Sometimes it is easier to debug when you are able to view a call trace of all function
calls in a particular program. This is especially true when working
with code that isn't yours or when debugging issues such as infinite
loops in your own code. The way I typically do this is by creating a
GDB commands file that defines breakpoints for each function I would like to
see in the trace. 

<br><br>

For each function breakpoint, I instruct GDB to print a short
backtrace and then continue execution. I can then stop the program run
at any time using <code>CTRL-C</code> and observe where the program
is, what functions are being called, and what arguments they are being
called with.

<br><br>

To illustrate this, consider the following short program that accepts
two arguments. It takes these two arguments, squares them, and then
finds the lowest common multiple of their squares. This means if you
pass in 4 and 10, it will find the LCM of 16 and 100. 

<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> I have defined functions for basic operations such as
squaring a number and adding two numbers just for illustrative
purposes. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
#include &ltstdlib.h&gt
// A program that will square two integers and then find the LCM
// of the resulting two integers. 

int squared(int x)       { return x*x; }
int modulo(int x, int y) { return x%y; }
int plus(int x, int y)   { return x+y; }

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int x, y, x2, y2, tmp;
    if (argc != 3) return 0;

    x = atoi(argv[1]);
    y = atoi(argv[2]);
    x2       = squared(x);
    y2 = tmp = squared(y);

    while (1) {
        if (modulo(tmp,x2) == 0) break;
        tmp = plus(tmp,y2);
    }
    printf("LCM is %d\n", tmp);
}
</blockquote>

<br>

I then use the following GDB commands file to define the breakpoints
and the commands to run for each breakpoint. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
set args 4 10

break squared
command
silent
backtrace 1
continue
end

break modulo
command
silent
backtrace 1
continue
end

break plus
command
silent
backtrace 1
continue
end

run
</blockquote>

<br>

After compiling my program (making sure to use <code>gcc -g</code> to
add in debug information) I can run the program using <code>gdb</code> and view the
trace.
