<! Hi Planet! - SSH: Disable checking host key against known_hosts file. >

<br><br>

Hi Everyone! Since this is my first post it is going to be short and
sweet. :) 

<br><br>

I work on a daily basis with Linux Servers that must be installed,
configured, re-installed, configured etc... Over and over, develop and
test. Our primary means of communication with these servers is through
ssh. Every time a server is re-installed it generates a new ssh key
and thus you will always get a "Man in the Middle Attack" warning from
SSH like:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@fedorabook .ssh]# ssh 1.1.1.2
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
08:50:e8:e4:1b:17:fd:69:08:bf:44:f2:c4:e4:8a:27.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts:1
RSA host key for 1.1.1.2 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
</blockquote>

<br><br>

You then have to open the <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> 
file and remove the offending key.

<br><br>

Since this is quite a mind numbing and time wasting task, I decided to
win back
those precious seconds. While perusing the <code>ssh_config</code> 
man page, I notice in the description of the 
<code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code>
option that: 

<br><br>

<b><i>
"The host keys of known hosts will be verified automatically in all
cases."
</b></i>

<br><br>

This means that there is virtually no way to make it ignore the fact
that the key has changed. At least there is no "designed" way. 

<br><br>

I then started looking at the file that the remote key is checked
against; the <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> file.

<br><br>

From what I can tell it is also impossible to disable writing remote
host keys to this file. 

<br><br>

So here we are with:

<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>
No way to stop writing remote host keys into the known_hosts file
    <li>
No way to ignore the fact that the key in the known_hosts file
doesn't match the key in the (newly reinstalled) target server. 

</ol>

<br><br>

What is the solution to this?

<br><br>

Well, since we can't disable writing new keys to the known_hosts file
and we can't disable checking keys that are in the known_hosts file,
why don't we just make the known_hosts file always be empty. Yep,
that's right. Let's just point the known_hosts file to 
<code>/dev/null</code>.

<br><br>

Turns out you can do this by setting the UserKnownHostsFile option in the 
<code>~/.ssh/config</code> file.

<br><br>

<blockquote>
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
</blockquote>

<br><br>

Voila! Now you will never be bothered by the same message again. It
isn't all fruit and berries though. Now, since your known_hosts file
is always empty, you will <b>always</b> be presented with the
following message <b>every time</b> you ssh to any server:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@fedorabook .ssh]# ssh 1.1.1.2
The authenticity of host '1.1.1.2 (1.1.1.2)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 08:50:e8:e4:1b:17:fd:69:08:bf:44:f2:c4:e4:8a:27.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</blockquote>

<br><br>

In other words, you just traded one pain for another. However there is
a solution for this as well :). We can make SSH automatically write
new host keys to the known_hosts file by setting
<code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> to "no" in the
<code>~/.ssh/config</code> file. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
StrictHostKeyChecking=no
</blockquote>

<br><br>

And now you are smooth sailing to connect away without the impedence
of interactive warning and error messages. Beware, however, that there 
are some security implications to performing the modifications that I
have suggested. The web page 
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/ssh-host-key-protection">
here</a> has an overview of SSH security, the different ssh options, and 
the implications of each. Of course, it suggests that you shouldn't set 
<code>StrictHostKeyChecking=no</code> but in my case, working on
lab/test machines without sensitive data on them, I decided to take the risk. 

<br><br>

Enjoy!
