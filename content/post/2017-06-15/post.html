<p>Hey everyone! Now that the Fedora Beta has been <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-the-release-of-fedora-26-beta/">officially released</a> the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Atomic_WG">Fedora Atomic Working Group</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Cloud_SIG">Fedora Cloud SIG</a> would like to get the community together next week to find and squash some bugs! We are organizing a test day for Tuesday June 20th.</p>
<p>For this test day we are going to test both Atomic Host content as well as Fedora Cloud Base content. Vagrant Boxes will be available to test with as well. See the <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/atomic/prerelease/">Fedora Atomic Host Pre-Release Page</a> for links to artifacts for Fedora Atomic Host and the <a href="https://alt.fedoraproject.org/prerelease/index.html">Alternative Downloads Beta Page</a> for links for the Beta Cloud Base Images. We have qcows, AMIs, ISOs! Oh Man!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2017-06-20_Cloud-Atomic_Testday">wiki page</a> for the Atomic/Cloud test day has a lot of good information on what/how to test. After you've done some testing you can log your results in the <a href="http://testdays.fedorainfracloud.org/events/22">test day app</a>. If you're available to test on the test day (or any other time) please do some testing and report your results!</p>
<p>Happy testing and we hope to see you on test day!</p>
<p>Dusty</p>
