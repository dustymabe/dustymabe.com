<! Trace Function Calls Using GDB Revisited! >

<br>

In an earlier
<a
href="http://dustymabe.com/2012/10/14/trace-function-calls-using-gdb/">
post
</a>
I discussed how to trace calls using GDB so that function
calls and their arguments can easily be viewed. What I neglected to mention
was 
<a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Set-Breaks.html">
<code>rbreak</code>
</a>
, a feature of GDB to be able to set breakpoints using a regular expression. 

<br><br>

Using <code>rbreak</code> you can get the same functionality but with
much less effort. For example, to get the same behavior as before
(setting a breakpoint on each function call and printing a trace of
 the bottom most level) all you need to provide to GDB are the following
commands:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
set args 4 10

rbreak file.c:.
command
silent
backtrace 1
continue 
end

run
</blockquote>

<br> 

I have placed these commands in a file called gdb_commands. The
<code>rbreak</code>
command above tells GDB to set a breakpoint on any function call
within file.c. With a quick call to GDB we find almost the exact same
functionality as we had before.

<br><br>

In my previous example, if you had 50 functions that
you wanted to trace, you needed 50 <code>break</code> commands as well
as 50 <code>command</code> blocks.

<br><br>

Considering this fact, it is apparent that <code>rbreak</code> is much
more efficient and friendly for when you are setting breakpoints
from the GDB cli. Another extremely useful feature is that it also
works for c++ classes, so you can break on any function in a class
regardless of what file the function is defined in. 

<br><br>

To show an example of this I converted all the math function calls
from the program in file.c to a c++ class. I put the result in a file
called file.cc (shown below).

<br><br>

<blockquote>
#include &ltstdio.h&gt
#include &ltstdlib.h&gt
// A program that will square two integers and then find the LCM
// of the resulting two integers. 
class Math {
    public:
        int squared(int x)       { return x*x; }
        int modulo(int x, int y) { return x%y; }
        int plus(int x, int y)   { return x+y; }
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int x, y, x2, y2, tmp;
    if (argc != 3) return 0; 

    Math* m = new Math;

    x = atoi(argv[1]);  
    y = atoi(argv[2]);
    x2       = m->squared(x);
    y2 = tmp = m->squared(y);

    while (1) {
        if (m->modulo(tmp,x2) == 0) break;
        tmp = m->plus(tmp,y2);
    }
    printf("LCM is %d\n", tmp);
}
</blockquote>

<br><br>

I then used the <code>rbreak Math::</code> command in the following
GDB commands file (I named this one gdb_commands2) to run GDB and set 
up the break points. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
set args 4 10

rbreak Math::
command
silent
backtrace 1
continue 
end

run
</blockquote>

<br>

And.. Here we are with the final result:

<br><br>
