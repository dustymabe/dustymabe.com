<! Capture Elusive cloud-init Debug Output With journalctl >

<br>

Recently I have been trying to debug some problems with cloud-init in
the alpha versions of cloud images for CentOS 7 and Fedora 21. What I have found is that
it's not so straight forward to figure out how to set up debug
logging.

<br><br>

The defaults (defined in 
<a href="/2014-09-08/05_logging.cfg">
/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/05_logging.cfg
</a>
) for some reason don't really capture the debug output in
<code>/var/log/cloud-init.log</code>. Luckily, though, on 
<code>systemd</code>
based systems we can get most of that output by using 
<code>journalctl</code>.

There are several services releated to cloud-init and if you want to
get the output from all of them you can just use wildcard matching in
<code>journalctl</code> (freshly added in 
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=ea18a4b57e2bb94af7b3ecb7abdaec40e9f485f0">
ea18a4b
</a>
) like so:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@f21test ~]# journalctl --unit cloud-*
...debug...debug...blah...blah
</blockquote>

<br>

This worked great in Fedora 21, but in CentOS/RHEL 7 this actually
won't work because wildcard matching is too new. As a result I found
another way to get the same output. It just so happens that the
services all use the same executable
(<code>/usr/bin/cloud-init</code>) so I was able to use that as a
trigger:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@c7test ~]# journalctl /usr/bin/cloud-init
...debug...debug...blah...blah
</blockquote>

<br>

I hope others can find this useful when debugging cloud-init.

Cheers,
