<p>Since the release of Fedora 22, Fedora began creating Vagrant boxes for cloud images in order to make it easier to set up a local environment for development or testing. In the Fedora 22 release cycle we worked out quite a few kinks and we are again releasing <em>libvirt</em> and <em>virtualbox</em> Vagrant boxes for Fedora 23.</p>
<p>Additionally, for Fedora 23 we are making it easier for the users to grab these boxes by having them indexed in Hashicorp's <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/fedora">Atlas</a>. Atlas is essentially an index of Vagrant boxes that makes it easy to distribute them (think of it like a Docker registry for virtual machine images). By indexing the Fedora boxes in Atlas, users now have the option of using the <code>vagrant</code> software to download and add the boxes automatically, rather than the user having to go grab the boxes directly from the <a href="https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/23/Cloud/x86_64/Images/">mirrors</a> first (although this is still an option).</p>
<p>In order to get started with the Fedora cloud base image, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code># vagrant init fedora/23-cloud-base &amp;&amp; vagrant up</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, to get started with Fedora Atomic host, run this command:</p>
<pre><code># vagrant init fedora/23-atomic-host &amp;&amp; vagrant up</code></pre>
<p>The above commands will grab the latest indexed images in Atlas and start a virtual machine without the user having to go download the image first. This will make it easier for Fedora users to develop and test on Fedora! If you haven't delved into Vagrant yet then you can get started by visiting the <a href="https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tools/vagrant/about.html">Vagrant page</a> on the <a href="https://developer.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Developer Portal</a>. Let us know on the Fedora Cloud <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/cloud">mailing list</a> if you have any trouble.</p>
