A couple of us recently gave an update to our Customer Experience team
at Red Hat on the improvements that were made in Red Hat CoreOS for
OpenShift 4.6. My part of the presentation focused on the new Live ISO
that is now used for Fedora/Red Hat CoreOS installations and also the
improvements that we made for being able to copy the install
environment networking configuration into the installed system via 
[`coreos-installer --copy-network`](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/212). 

I've cut the presentation/demo video down to my sections and shared it
below in case other people find it useful. You can watch below or
[download the file](https://dustymabecom.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-11-18_RHCOS-ISO-Network.mp4)
for later use.
