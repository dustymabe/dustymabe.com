<! RPM File Colors >

<h4><i> What are RPM file colors? </i></h4>

<br>

When building a package <code>rpm</code> will tag each file within the
package with a file
color. Usually the file color will fit into one of four categories as described by
Jeff Johnson
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/rpm-list/2003-May/msg00228.html">
here.
</a>
These categories are:

<br>

<ul>
    <li>
    0 is unknown or other
    <li>
    1 is Elf32
    <li>
    2 is Elf64
    <li>
    3 is (contains) both
</ul>

So why does <code>rpm</code> do this? The short answer is "for
multilib support". Basically so we can install both the 32bit and
64bit version of a package on the system and have some hopes of
everything still working correctly. 

<br>
<br>

An example of this would be a system that needed both the 32bit and
64bit version of <code>glibc</code> (chances are you have them both
        installed because some package has been slow to move to 64bit
        and only provides software compiled for 32bit). The problem
with having both rpms installed is that both rpms provide some of the
same files (i.e <code>/sbin/ldconfig</code>). Which one should rpm
choose? This is where file colors come in.

<br><br>

When installing a file from a new package
<code>rpm</code> will check to see if the file is already provided by
another rpm and will then use file color to determine if the file
should be replaced or left alone. The current behavior of
<code>rpm</code> is to prefer 64bit over 32bit files.

That means when both i686 and x86_64 <code>glibc</code> are installed,
<code>ldconfig</code> should be 64bit. This can easily be checked:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -q glibc
glibc-2.12-1.107.el6_4.2.x86_64
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -q --filecolor glibc | grep /sbin/ldconfig
/sbin/ldconfig  2
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -ivvh glibc-*.i686.rpm nss-softokn-freebl-*.i686.rpm
...
D: fini      100755  1 (   0,   0)    787476 /sbin/ldconfig;521a4bd1 skipcolor
...
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -qs glibc-2.12-1.107.el6_4.2.x86_64 | grep /sbin/ldconfig
normal        /sbin/ldconfig
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -qs glibc-2.12-1.107.el6_4.2.i686 | grep /sbin/ldconfig
wrong color   /sbin/ldconfig
[root@Cent64 ~]# file /sbin/ldconfig 
/sbin/ldconfig: ELF 64-bit LSB executable,...
</blockquote>

<br>


As expected the 64bit <code>ldconfig</code> was left in place as
denoted by <code>skipcolor</code> in the output. It is also shown when
querying the state of the i686 <code>glibc</code> that <code>/sbin/ldconfig</code>
has the "wrong color".


<h4><i>RPM file colors gone bad.</i></h4>

<br>

Yes, file colors are a nice hack (that takes place in the background)
    to make multilib work. Most of the
time it works just fine and the user is none the wiser. However,
     sometimes there are nasty little complexities that this can
     introduce. 

<br><br>

HP provides the <code>hp-health</code> rpm to help monitor HP hardware. In
<a href="http://downloads.linux.hp.com/downloads/PSP/RedHatEnterpriseServer/6.0/packages/x86_64/hp-health-8.6.2.2-14.rhel6.x86_64.rpm">
hp-health-8.6.2.2-14.rhel6.x86_64.rpm 
</a>
<code>/sbin/hpasmcli</code> was
32bit.

In
<a href="http://downloads.linux.hp.com/downloads/PSP/RedHatEnterpriseServer/6.0/packages/x86_64/hp-health-9.1.0.42-54.rhel6.x86_64.rpm">
hp-health-9.1.0.42-54.rhel6.x86_64.rpm
</a>
<code>/sbin/hpasmcli</code> had changed to 64bit.  This can be seen by
querying the rpms:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -qp --filecolor hp-health-8.6.2.2-14.rhel6.x86_64.rpm | grep /sbin/hpasmcli
/sbin/hpasmcli  1
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -qp --filecolor hp-health-9.1.0.42-54.rhel6.x86_64.rpm | grep /sbin/hpasmcli
/sbin/hpasmcli  2
</blockquote>

<br>


Upgrading from the older rpm to the newer rpm has the expected
behavior:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -i hp-health-8.6.2.2-14.rhel6.x86_64.rpm &>/dev/null
[root@Cent64 ~]# file /sbin/hpasmcli 
/sbin/hpasmcli: ELF 32-bit LSB executable,...
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -U hp-health-9.1.0.42-54.rhel6.x86_64.rpm &>/dev/null
[root@Cent64 ~]# file /sbin/hpasmcli 
/sbin/hpasmcli: ELF 64-bit LSB executable,...
</blockquote>

<br>

The problem comes in, however, when you try to go the other way. I
know its not that common but sometimes I do "upgrade" to the older
version of a package:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -Uvv --oldpackage hp-health-8.6.2.2-14.rhel6.x86_64.rpm
...
D: fini      100755  1 (   0,   0)    179005 /sbin/hpasmcli;521a55ec skipcolor
...
[root@Cent64 ~]# file /sbin/hpasmcli 
/sbin/hpasmcli: ELF 64-bit LSB executable,...
[root@Cent64 ~]# rpm -qs hp-health | grep /sbin/hpasmcli
wrong color   /sbin/hpasmcli
</blockquote>

<br>

Basically what happened here is the 64bit version of
<code>hpasmcli</code> was left in place. This was not what I expected
when I originally did the "downgrade" and was caused by the subtle
behavior of file colors within <code>rpm</code>. The workaround for
this is to just fully uninstall and reinstall the version that you
desire.
