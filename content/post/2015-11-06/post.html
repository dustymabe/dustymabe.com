<p>This week was the release week for Fedora 23, and the Fedora Project has again worked together with the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> team to make Fedora 23 available in their service. If you're not familiar with DigitalOcean already, it is a dead simple cloud hosting platform which is great for developers.</p>
<h2 id="using-fedora-on-digitalocean">Using Fedora on DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>There are a couple of things to note if you are planning on using Fedora on DigitalOcean services and machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like with other DigitalOcean images, you will <strong>log in with your ssh key as root</strong>, rather than the typical fedora user that you may be familiar with when logging in to a Fedora cloud image.</li>
<li>Similar to Fedora 21 and Fedora 22, Fedora 23 also has <strong>SELinux enabled by default</strong>.</li>
<li>In DigitalOcean images there is <strong>no firewall on by default</strong>, and there are <strong>no cloud provided firewall solution</strong>. It is highly recommended that you secure your system after you log in.</li>
<li>Fedora 23 should be available in <strong>all the newest datacenters in each region</strong>, but some legacy datacenters aren't supported.</li>
<li>If you have a problem you think is Fedora specific then drop us an email at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#x6f;&#58;&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#64;&#108;&#x69;&#x73;&#116;&#x73;&#46;&#102;&#x65;&#100;&#x6f;&#114;&#x61;&#112;&#114;&#x6f;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;" class="email">&#x63;&#108;&#x6f;&#x75;&#100;&#64;&#108;&#x69;&#x73;&#116;&#x73;&#46;&#102;&#x65;&#100;&#x6f;&#114;&#x61;&#112;&#114;&#x6f;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;</a>, ping us in #fedora-cloud on freenode, or visit the Fedora cloud <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/cloud/report/1">trac</a> to see if it is already being worked on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Visit the DigitalOcean <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/features/linux-distribution/fedora/">Fedora landing page</a> and spin one up today!</p>
<p>Happy Developing!<br />Dusty</p>
