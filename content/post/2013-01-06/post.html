<! OS Upgrade and Rollback Using BTRFS >

<br>

I recently decided to try out the snapshotting capabilities of the  
relatively new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">
BTRFS
</a>
filesystem. 
I have been using the snapshot and rollback capability of LVM (using
<code>lvconvert --merge</code>) for a while now so I figured I would 
check out BTRFS
to see how it stacks up. 

<br><br>

To get up to speed on how to use BTRFS I found the 
<a href="http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/BTRFS_Fun">
BTRFS Fun
</a> 
web page a good reference. I converted an existing Fedora 17 virtual
machine  
to use BTRFS for the filesystems
(I may cover how I did this in a later post). The <i>disk</i> inside
the virtual machine contains three 
partitions as is shown below:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sr0     11:0    1  4.2G  0 rom
vda    252:0    0   20G  0 disk
├─vda1 252:1    0  500M  0 part /boot
├─vda2 252:2    0    4G  0 part [SWAP]
└─vda3 252:3    0 15.6G  0 part /
[root@guest1 ~]#
</blockquote>

<br>

As you can see from the output, <code>vda1</code> is for <code>/boot</code>
while <code>vda3</code> is for <code>/</code>; the root partition.
After converting from ext4, both <code>vda1</code> and
<code>vda3</code> have BTRFS <b><i>volumes</i></b> (filesystems) on them. 
Now I am free to snapshot them as I please. 

<br>

<h4><i> Taking The Snapshots </i></h4>

<br>

In BTRFS snapshots are actually 
<b><i>subvolumes</i></b>  
(see 
<a href="http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/BTRFS_Fun#Playing_with_subvolumes_and_snapshots">
here
</a> for an explanation of subvolumes). This means when I create a
snapshot of <code>/boot</code> and <code>/</code> it is actually
creating a subvolume.

<br><br>

To create the snapshots you use the
<code>btrfs subvolume snapshot</code>
command and you must specify where in the filesystem you want the
snapshot to reside. To help myself not get confused I created a
<code>/boot/.snapshots</code> directory and a 
<code>/.snapshots</code> directory which is where I will create the 
snapshots. The creation of the snapshots is shown below: 

<br><br>


<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# mkdir /boot/.snapshots
[root@guest1 ~]# mkdir /.snapshots
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume snapshot /boot /boot/.snapshots/snap1
Create a snapshot of '/boot' in '/boot/.snapshots/snap1'
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume snapshot / /.snapshots/snap1
Create a snapshot of '/' in '/.snapshots/snap1'
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume list /boot
ID 256 top level 5 path .snapshots/snap1
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume list /
ID 270 top level 5 path .snapshots/snap1
[root@guest1 ~]#
</blockquote>

<br>

If you notice in the output of the <code>btrfs subvolume list</code>
commands above, the subvolumes (snapshots) that were created have a
unique ID associated with them. For each BTRFS filesystem there is
also an implicit "<i><b>root subvolume</b></i>" with an ID of
<code>0</code>. 

<br><br>

These IDs can be used to set which subvolume is the
one that is used when the BTRFS filesystem is mounted. 
In order to be able to easily identify if I had mounted a snapshot or
the root subvolume, I placed a single file <code>snap1_sub</code> into the 
root directory of each snapshot.

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# touch /boot/.snapshots/snap1/snap1_sub
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# touch /.snapshots/snap1/snap1_sub
</blockquote>

<h4><i> Upgrade From F17 to F18 Beta </i></h4>

<br>

At this point the snapshots were all set up and I could go ahead with
upgrading from Fedora 17 to the Fedora 18 beta. I followed the steps
from the 
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upgrading_Fedora_using_yum">
Fedora Web Site
</a>
on how to do this. After rebooting I indeed had upgraded to Fedora 18: 


<br>


<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Fedora release 18 (Spherical Cow)
[root@guest1 ~]#
</blockquote>

<br>

However, as usual the upgrade didn't yield a perfectly working
system. As far as the command line was concerned everything
seemed to be fine but my desktop session was a no go and the logs 
indicated there was something awry with the X configuration.

<br><br>

No need to fear! The snapshots are there! 

<h4><i> Reverting The Snapshots </i></h4>

<br>

What we want to do now is revert the changes and go back to Fedora 17.
How do we do that?

<br><br>

One way is to make the snapshot subvolume be the default subvolume
that is used when the filesystem is mounted. I set both
<code>/boot</code> and <code>/</code> to default to their snapshots by
using the <code>btrfs subvolume set-default</code> command:  

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume list /boot/
ID 256 gen 29 top level 5 path .snapshots/snap1
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume set-default 256 /boot/
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume list /
ID 270 gen 139 top level 5 path .snapshots/snap1
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume set-default 270 /
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# reboot
</blockquote>

<br>

After a quick reboot I was back up and running. I wanted to verify I
was in the snapshot so I checked to see if the files I had created
were in the root of the filesystems:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# ls -l /boot/snap1_sub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan  4 23:20 /boot/snap1_sub
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# ls -l /snap1_sub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan  4 23:20 /snap1_sub
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Fedora release 17 (Beefy Miracle)
</blockquote>

<br>

The next step was to restore the root subvolume (ID=0) of each filesystem. I
started with <code>/boot</code> (from <code>vda1</code>). To do this
you mount the root subvolume and then use <code>rsync</code> to restore any files
that were changed. 

<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> In the <code>rsync</code> command I was careful to exclude the file
that I created to let me know I was in the snapshot as well as the 
directory that is used for the snapshots. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# mount -o subvolid=0 /dev/vda1 /mnt
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# time rsync --delete -avHAX --exclude=snap1_sub --exclude=/.snapshots /boot/ /mnt/

<br>

From the output we can see that upgrading caused about 34M (36454169
bytes) of changes to the filesystem and it took less than a second to
revert the changes. 

<br><br>

Now that the <code>/boot</code> filesystem has been restored we need
to set the default subvolume to mount again. We need to reset it back
to automatically mount the root subvolume. 

<br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> When setting the default subvolume you have to be careful 
and make sure to specify the location where the root subvolume is
mounted (in this case <code>/mnt</code>). There is a small bit of text
that attempts to explain why this is necessary on the
<a href="http://www.funtoo.org/wiki/BTRFS_Fun#Way_.231:_Fiddle_with_the_default_subvolume_number">
BTRFS Fun
</a>
web page. 

<br>


<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume set-default 0 /mnt
[root@guest1 ~]# umount /mnt
</blockquote>

<br>

Now on to the <code>/</code> filesystem. For this one I needed to tweak the
<code>rsync</code> command to make sure that it didn't attempt to sync anything 
outside of the 
filesystem; we don't care to sync fake filesystems like
<code>/dev</code> 
<code>/proc</code> 
<code>/sys</code> 
etc.. Also we wanted to exclude <code>/mnt</code> since that is where
the root subvolume is mounted. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# mount -o subvolid=0 /dev/vda3 /mnt
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# time rsync --one-file-system --delete -avHAX --exclude=/snap1_sub --exclude=/.snapshots --exclude=/mnt / /mnt

[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# reboot
</blockquote>

<br>

And we are done.. It took less than 10 minutes to revert ~3G of
changes that were made. After the reboot my Fedora 17 instance was
fully restored and we were in the root subvolumes as can be seen below
from the absence of the <code>snap1_sub</code> files that I had
created. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# cat /etc/redhat-release
Fedora release 17 (Beefy Miracle)
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# ls -l /boot/snap1_sub
ls: cannot access /boot/snap1_sub: No such file or directory
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# ls -l /snap1_sub
ls: cannot access /snap1_sub: No such file or directory
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]#
</blockquote>

<br>

The final step was to delete the snapshots as they are no longer
needed. 

<br><br>

<blockquote>
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume delete /boot/.snapshots/snap1
Delete subvolume '/boot/.snapshots/snap1'
[root@guest1 ~]#
[root@guest1 ~]# btrfs subvolume delete /.snapshots/snap1
Delete subvolume '/.snapshots/snap1'
</blockquote>

<h4><i> Conclusions </i></h4>

Overall I believe the snapshotting feature of BTRFS is quite useful.
I like the fact that you don't have to carve out new storage for the
snapshots like in LVM, but at the same time I don't like how it
doesn't seem to be very easy to detect how much space the snapshots
are using up. I also don't like the fact that reverting the snapshots
are a bit <i>manual</i> and require an external tool like
<code>rsync</code>. In LVM it is handled all in one command: 
<code>lvconvert --merge</code>. That being said, just from experience
it does seem that reverting the snapshots seems to be a bit faster
with BTRFS than with LVM snapshots. I would have to run another test
to be sure of this.  

<br>
Happy New Year Everyone!
