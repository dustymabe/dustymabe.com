<! TermRecord: Terminal Screencast in a Self-Contained HTML File >

<h4><i> Introduction </i></h4>

<br>

Some time ago I wrote a few posts (
<a href="http://dustymabe.com/2012/01/11/create-a-screencast-of-a-terminal-session-using-scriptreplay/">1,</a>
<a href="http://dustymabe.com/2012/04/15/terminal-screencast-revisit-log-output-from-a-multiplexed-terminal/">2</a>
) on how to use <code>script</code> to record a terminal session
and then <code>scriptreplay</code> to play it back. This functionality 
can be very useful by enabling you the power to <i>show</i> others
what happens when you do <i><b>insert anything here</b></i>.

<br><br>

I have been happy with this solution for a while until one day 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~worichte/">Wolfgang Richter</a>
commented on my original 
<a href="http://dustymabe.com/2012/01/11/create-a-screencast-of-a-terminal-session-using-scriptreplay/">post</a>
and shared a project he has been working on known as 
<a href="https://github.com/theonewolf/TermRecord">TermRecord.</a>

<br><br>

I gave it a spin and have been using it quite a bit. Sharing a
terminal recording now becomes much easier as you can simply email the .html
file or you can host it yourself and share links. As long the 
people you are sharing with have a browser then they can watch the
playback. Thus, it is not tied to a system with a particular piece of
software and clicking a link to view is very easy to do :)


<h4><i> Basics of TermRecord </i></h4>

<br>

Before anything else we need to install <code>TermRecord</code>. Currently
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/TermRecord">TermRecord</a>
is available in the 
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/">python package index</a>
(hopefully will be packaged in some major distributions soon)
and can be installed using <code>pip</code>.

<br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# pip install TermRecord

Now you can make a self-contained html file for sharing in a couple of ways.

<br><br>

First, you can use TermRecord to convert already existing timing and 
log files that were created using the <code>script</code> command by specifying
them as inputs to <code>TermRecord</code>:

<br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# TermRecord -o screencast.html -t screencast.timing -s screencast.log
</blockquote>

<br>

The other option is to create a new recording using <code>TermRecord</code> like so:

<br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# TermRecord -o screencast.html 
Script started, file is /tmp/tmp5I4SYq
[root@localhost ~]# 
[root@localhost ~]# #This is a screencast.
[root@localhost ~]# exit
exit
Script done, file is /tmp/tmp5I4SYq
</blockquote>

<br>

And.. Done. Now you can email or share the html file any way you like. If you would like to see 
some examples of terminal recordings you can check out the 
<a href="https://github.com/theonewolf/TermRecord">TermRecord github page</a>
or
<a href="http://dustymabe.com/content/2014-05-10/screencast.html">here</a> is one from my
previous post on wordpress/docker.

Cheers,
