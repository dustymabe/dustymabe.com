.. F22 Cloud/Atomic Test Day May 7th!
.. ==================================

Hey everyone! Fedora 22 is on the cusp of being released and the
Fedora Cloud Working Group has elected to organize a test day for May
7th in order to work out some bugs before shipping it off to the rest
of the world. 

With a new release comes some new features and tools. We are
working on Vagrant images as well as a testing tool called Tunir. Joe
Brockmeier has a nice writeup_ about Vagrant and Kushal Das
maintains some docs_ on Tunir.

.. _writeup: http://fedoramagazine.org/using-fedora-22-atomic-vagrant-boxes/
.. _docs:    http://tunir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

On the test day we will be testing both the Cloud Base Image and the Fedora Atomic 
Host cloud image. The landing pages where we are organizing instructions and information
are 
`here <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2015-05-07_Cloud>`_ 
(for Cloud Base) and 
`here <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2015-05-07_Atomic>`_
(for Atomic). If you're
available to test on the test day (or any other time) please go there
and fill out your name and test results.

Happy Testing!

Dusty
