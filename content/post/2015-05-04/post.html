<p>Hey everyone! Fedora 22 is on the cusp of being released and the Fedora Cloud Working Group has elected to organize a test day for May 7th in order to work out some bugs before shipping it off to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>With a new release comes some new features and tools. We are working on Vagrant images as well as a testing tool called Tunir. Joe Brockmeier has a nice <a href="http://fedoramagazine.org/using-fedora-22-atomic-vagrant-boxes/">writeup</a> about Vagrant and Kushal Das maintains some <a href="http://tunir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">docs</a> on Tunir.</p>
<p>On the test day we will be testing both the Cloud Base Image and the Fedora Atomic Host cloud image. The landing pages where we are organizing instructions and information are <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2015-05-07_Cloud">here</a> (for Cloud Base) and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2015-05-07_Atomic">here</a> (for Atomic). If you're available to test on the test day (or any other time) please go there and fill out your name and test results.</p>
<p>Happy Testing!</p>
<p>Dusty</p>
