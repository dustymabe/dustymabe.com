<! Docker: Copy Into A Container Volume >


<br>

I need to copy a few files into my docker container.. Should be easy
right? Turns out it's not so trivial. In Docker 1.0.0 and earlier the 
<code>docker cp</code>
command can be used to copy files from a container to the host, but
not the other way around...

<br><br>

Most of the time you can work around this by using an <code>ADD</code>
statement in the Dockerfile but I often need to populate some data within 
data-only volume containers before I start other containers that use the 
data. To achieve copying data into the volume you can simply use
<code>tar</code>
and pipe the contents into the volume within a new container like so:

<br>

<blockquote>
[root@localhost ~]# docker run -d -i -t -v /volumes/wpdata --name wpdata mybusybox sh
416ea2a877267f566ef8b054a836e8b6b2550b347143c4fe8ed2616e11140226
[root@localhost ~]# 
[root@localhost ~]# tar -c files/ | docker run -i --rm -w /volumes/wpdata/ --volumes-from wpdata mybusybox tar -xv
files/
files/file8.txt
files/file9.txt
files/file4.txt
files/file7.txt
files/file1.txt
files/file6.txt
files/file2.txt
files/file5.txt
files/file10.txt
files/file3.txt
</blockquote>

<br>

So.. In the example I created a new data-only volume container named
<i>wpdata</i> and then ran <code>tar</code> to pipe the contents of a directory to
a new container that also used the same volumes as the original
container.

Not so tough, but not as easy as <code>docker cp</code>. I think
<code>docker cp</code> should have this functionality sometime in the
future ( issue tracker 
<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/6580">here</a>
).

Enjoy
