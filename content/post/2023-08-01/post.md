Earlier this summer I spoke at the
[Fedora 38 release party](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux_38_Release_Party_Schedule)
about Fedora CoreOS. As part of this I had the privilege of giving the
presentation alongside [Marc Pusey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcpusey/)
from Columbia University. Marc talked about how Columbia University uses
Fedora CoreOS and his experience participating in the Fedora and Fedora CoreOS
communities.

It was a real treat and quite nice to see Fedora CoreOS being applied
in such diverse ways for research and learning.

You won't regret it!
