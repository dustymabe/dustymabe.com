<p>Hey everyone! Fedora 23 has been baking in the oven. The Fedora Cloud WG has elected to do a temperature check on September 8th.</p>
<p>For this test day we are going to concentrate on the base image. We will have vagrant boxes (see <a href="http://fedoramagazine.org/running-vagrant-fedora-22/">this</a> page for how to set up your machine), qcow images, raw images, and AWS EC2 images. In a later test day we will focus on the Atomic images and Docker images.</p>
<p>The landing page for the Fedora Cloud Base test day is <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2015-09-08_Fedora_Cloud_Base">here</a>. If you're available to test on the test day (or any other time) please go there and fill out your name and test results. Also, don't forget that you can use some of our new projects <a href="https://github.com/Rorosha/testCloud">testcloud</a> (copr <a href="https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/roshi/testCloud/">link</a>) and/or <a href="http://tunir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Tunir</a> to aid in testing.</p>
<p>Happy testing and we hope to see you on test day!</p>
<p>Dusty</p>
