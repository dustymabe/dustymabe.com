<! Create a screencast of a terminal session using scriptreplay.  >
<br><br>

I recently ran into an issue where I needed to demo a project without
actually being present for the demo. I thought about recording (into
some video format) a screencast of my terminal window and then having
my audience play it at the time of the demo. This would have worked
just fine, but, as I was browsing the internet searching for exactly
how to record a screencast of this nature, I ran across a
<a href="http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/279/record-the-terminal-session-and-replay-later/">
blog post
</a>
talking about how to play back terminal sessions using the output of
the <code> script</code> program. This piqued my interest for several
reasons:

<ol>
    <li>
I have used script many times to log results of tests. 
    <li>
This method of recording a shell session is much more efficient than
recording it into video because it only stores the actual text of the
output as well as some timing information. 
</ol>

<br><br>

In order to "record" using script you store the terminal 
output and the timing information to two different files using a
command like the following:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
script -t 2> screencast.timing screencast.log
</blockquote>

<br><br>

The <code> -t</code> in the command causes script to output timing
data to standard error. The <code> 2> screencast.timing</code> causes
standard error to be redirected to the file <b>screencast.timing</b>.
The <b>screencast.log</b> file will hold everything printed on the
terminal during the course of the screencast session.  

<br><br>

After running the command, execute a few programs (<code>ls</code>, 
<code>echo "Hi Planet"</code>, etc...) and then type <code>exit</code>
to end the session. 

<br><br>

Now the screencast is stored in the two files. You can play back the
screencast using:

<br><br>

<blockquote>
scriptreplay screencast.timing screencast.log
</blockquote>

<br><br>

And Voila. As long as your target audience has a box with
script/scriptreplay installed then they can view your screencast!

<br><br>

I have included a 
<a href="http://dustymabe.com/content/2012-01-11/screencast.timing">
<b>screencast.timing</b>
</a>
and a
<a href="http://dustymabe.com/content/2012-01-11/screencast.log">
<b>screencast.log</b>
</a>
file you can
download and use with <code>scriptreplay</code> if you would like to demo this out.
The files combined are under 5K in size for a 1 minute 40 second
screencast, however I think the actual size of the files depends
more on how much data was output rather than the length of the
screencast.

<br><br>

Even better than using my screencast, create one yourself!

<br><br>

Enjoy!
